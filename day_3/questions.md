## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
 A conditional statement is a statement that only runs when the condition is reached.  Like in code this would be if 1 == 1 then you would have a true condition and if you have any code it would execute.  Another example would be so many dollar bills (say over 100) might result in a true condition.  Or so much weight loss might result in the condition of true and then a celebration.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
You are looking to find out when a given condition has been reached.
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if <condition>
  <block of code>
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
You would use the elsif statement

if <condition 1 >
elsif <condition 1,2,3 etc>
end

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if condition1
  block of code
elsif condition2
  block of code
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
  during a loop, you would want to exit.
  or during a user event.
  or during an evaluation process for like variables and stuff.
